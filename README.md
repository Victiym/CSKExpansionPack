# CSK's Expansion Pack

This Demon Bluff mod adds new characters to the game. Currently doesn't work on Standard mode.

The three characters in this Mod are:

- Cleric (Good Villager)
- Assassin (Good Villager)
- Atheist (Good Outcast)

You can download the file ending in .dll with the role name for the optional roles.

Current optional Add-On roles:

- Exorcist (Good Outcast)

Please download ArtSwap alongside this mod, as it doesn't have default character sprites.
